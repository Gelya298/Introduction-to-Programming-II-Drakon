<h1 style="display: none">The Global Intelligence Files</h1>
   <p>On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing <i>The Global Intelligence Files</i>, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered  "global intelligence" company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July  2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company  that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential  intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow  Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government  agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US  Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show  Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>

      Can you get more granular data on the safe room construction?<br />
    <br />
   Also, what MNC's or industries could be affected by this move?<br />
    <br />
   If this OC figure controls the ports (per Peter), what kinds of kickbacks<br />
   could be taking place with outbound containers? <br />

   chaika craziness<br />
   [**more coming on all of this, I could only chat briefly with Chaika...<br />
   pls keep the fact that he gave us this info under wraps, but we can use<br />
   the info other than that]<br />
   I'm leaning towards the fact that Putin is really cracking down on any<br />
   power player that doesn't play in his arena... and that the Tambov Clan<br />
   was soooo powerful and didn't listen to Putin as much as he wanted. This<br />
   is a HUGE nab for Chaika (congrats to him)... also a good note for Chaika<br />
   to leave on (he's quitting the Kremlin, so he says... and that is<br />
   classified info for the next week until I get the green light to go<br />
   forward on that huge Kremlin re-shuffle)<br />
   TAMBOV CRIMINAL GROUP<br />
    <br />
   The head of the Tambov Criminal Group Vladimir Barsukov was arrested on<br />
   this past week by the Prosecutor General Chaika's group. Barsukov, also<br />
   known as Kumarin, based his group out of St. Petersburg.<br />
    <br />
   He has many old friends within the inner circle, especially Alexei<br />
   Mordashov (Severstal) and Vladimir Yakunin (railways minister). Barsurkov<br />
   was a person that many in Russia tolerated because of his connections and<br />
   the fact that he was in charge of the highly powerful Tambov gang. But<br />
   Putin considered him a relic of a by-gone era and was eager to get rid of<br />
   him, though he was instrumental during Putin's earlier years. Putin<br />
   himself was "familiar" with Barsukov when he worked in the St. Petersburg<br />
   mayoral office.<br />
    <br />
   The entire operation to bring him down was orchestrated by Chaika along<br />
   with FSB head Nikolai Patrushev and Interior Min Rashid Nurgaliev, though<br />
   many tried to stop him-especially Yakunin and Mordashov. [sidenote:<br />
   Yakunin and Chaika have never been close and after the last attack on the<br />
   train from Moscow to St. Petersburg, the security forces turned to Chaika,<br />
   not Yakunin, for information and cooperation.]<br />
    <br />
   Barsukov was in a safe room and it took hours to pry him open from his<br />
   home. They had a huge amount of OMAN police forces with them, knowing that<br />
   this could have become really gross really fast.<br />
    <br />
   One of the breaking points was the fact that Barsukov wanted to gain<br />
   control over many oil infrastructure assets in St. Petersburg... Chaika<br />
   said that this was shocking because no real criminal organizations dare to<br />
   take claim on energy infrastructure. The joke Chaika said was, "they may<br />
   be crime bosses, but they don't want to mess with Surkov, Sechin,<br />
   Bogdanchikov or others or else they may learn what real pressure and<br />
   tactics looks like."<br />
    <br />
   The arrest of Barsurkov is expected to create a few repercussions... 1)<br />
   there will be a power struggle within the Tambov clan [I need to break<br />
   down what they control, can the CT team help?] 2) Chaika and others expect<br />
   atleast some retaliation, though they feel confident in their infiltration<br />
   of the organization to head most of it off 3) Yakunin and Mordashov will<br />
   really be after Chaika, Nurgaliev and Patrushev... Chaika isn't too<br />
   worried about this, but says that Yakunin is really petty about<br />
   retaliation.<br />
    <br />
   OTHER ISSUES...<br />
    <br />
   Chaika said he has already been under a lot of heat because of the<br />
   Politkovskaya arrests. He said that he would rather not tell me about the<br />
   "Chechen mastermind" they arrested. I asked if this was because he was not<br />
   really a mastermind and Chaika said that "many things needed to be tied up<br />
   as we head into this election and the end of Putin's reign." [I know this<br />
   is strange, but he kept saying things like, "Ivanov needs to have control<br />
   over the situation he's about to enter into.... Ivanov is known for his<br />
   distance from such situations, so they need to be wrapped up."]<br />
